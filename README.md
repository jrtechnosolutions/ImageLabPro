## üìã Description

This application is a comprehensive image processing laboratory built with OpenCV, Streamlit, and other Python libraries. It provides a wide range of image manipulation and analysis capabilities through an intuitive web interface, allowing users to upload images and apply various transformations and effects in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Basic Operations:** Resize, rotate, flip, and adjust brightness/contrast of images
- **Filtering:** Apply various filters including blur, Gaussian, median, and bilateral filtering
- **Color Spaces:** Convert images between RGB, HSV, LAB, and YCrCb color spaces
- **Thresholding:** Apply different thresholding techniques including binary, adaptive, and Otsu's method
- **Morphological Operations:** Perform erosion, dilation, opening, closing, and other morphological transformations
- **Edge Detection:** Detect edges using Canny, Sobel, Laplacian, and Scharr operators
- **Feature Detection:** Identify key features using Harris Corner, Shi-Tomasi, and FAST algorithms
- **Histogram Operations:** Analyze and equalize image histograms to enhance contrast
- **Advanced Effects:** Apply artistic transformations like pencil sketch, cartoon effect, and HDR

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Streamlit:** Interactive web interface with real-time updates
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision algorithms for image processing
- **NumPy:** Efficient numerical operations on image data
- **Matplotlib:** Visualization of image histograms and data
- **Pillow:** Image file handling and format conversion
